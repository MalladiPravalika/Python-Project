# Project Title
## Quiz Brain Game

## Simple Overview of Use/Purpose
A Python-based interactive quiz game that tests users on various topics using multiple-choice questions. The game dynamically evaluates the user's responses, tracks their score, and provides detailed results, including a summary of incorrect answers.

## Description
The Quiz Brain Game is a lightweight and engaging application designed for educational and recreational purposes. It challenges users with multiple-choice questions on diverse topics, making it ideal for self-assessment and learning. The system presents questions one at a time, validates user input, and calculates scores based on correct answers. At the end of the quiz, it provides a detailed result summary, including a list of incorrectly answered questions and their correct answers, ensuring a comprehensive feedback experience.

The quiz game is designed to test a user's knowledge through a series of multiple-choice questions, implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It is structured around three key components: a Question class, an abstract Quiz class, and a concrete implementation QuizBrain. The Question class encapsulates individual questions, including the text, available options, and the correct answer. The Quiz class serves as a blueprint, defining abstract methods for checking if questions remain, presenting the next question, and displaying the final results. The QuizBrain class implements this blueprint, handling the logic for presenting questions to the user, validating their answers, tracking the score, and maintaining a record of incorrect responses.

The game begins with a predefined set of questions, and users answer each question by selecting from the available options. The program validates the user's input, updates the score for correct answers, and records incorrect ones for review. At the end of the quiz, it displays the user's final score along with details of any incorrect answers. This modular and abstract design ensures flexibility, allowing for easy extension and customization, such as adding new features or integrating additional question formats. The game offers an interactive and user-friendly way to engage in knowledge testing and learning.
